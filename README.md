# Project
This project was generated with Angular CLI, to create a simple webpage that uses https://restcountries.eu API to get information about countries as well as Google Maps JavaScript API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) to show contry coordinats (restcontries) on the google maps.

To navigate on the webpage:
* Logo can be used as a button to go to the front page (as it used to be on the most of the webpages).
* On the contry infomation page you can press on border countries to open information about them.

## Google Maps JavaScript API
Unfortunately due to security reason I cannot post my API key publicly, if you have your key you can post it in `/src/app/app.module.ts` file
otherwise there will be error on the google maps: "Oops! Something went wrong."
